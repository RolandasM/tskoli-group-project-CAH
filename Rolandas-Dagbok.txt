Some more layout plans, reseach into pygame rect collision for buttons.

researching old projects, attempting to create a basic black square that on click gets a new random string

researching how to keep text inside rect, found TextWrap, spent the day making it work
Further planing on layout and functionality

Had basic clicks working, after some further tweaking of the TextWrap got some margin so the text
wouldnt be touching the edges of the rect.

Added user rectangles/trying to figure out how to make clickable rects from the card list for player hands
