Plan for the project
Main goals:

Database for cards

  jon-s-o:
    Was planning on creating the database(this is easy)
    From there i want to make sure i can work with the database through python(and possibly other ways as well)
    For example: being able to access database of CARDS and use them as an array in python for functions
    such as "DRAW CARD".
